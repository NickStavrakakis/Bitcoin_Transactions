# Bitcoin Transactions

## _Academic Year of 2018-2019_

This project is about constructing a system that will accept, process, record and answer queries about Bitcoin transactions. The implementation is based on a set of structures -hash tables, linked lists and binary trees - allowing the system to support the importation of a large volume of records and the execution of complex queries.
